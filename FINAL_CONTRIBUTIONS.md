# Final Contributions

This document outlines the key contributions made by the team members to the BullReckon trading platform project. The project is a comprehensive trading platform built using a microservices architecture with Turborepo for monorepo management.

## Contributors

### Abhishek Punhani

- **Project Initialization and Architecture**:
  - Initialized the Turborepo monorepo structure for efficient multi-package management.
  - Generalized central services including `baseApp`, `DbManager`, `RedisManager`, and `InternalApiStructure` to ensure consistency across microservices.

- **Authentication System**:
  - Developed the complete authentication system, handling user registration, login, JWT token management, and session handling.

- **Calc Server**:
  - Implemented the majority of the Calc Server, responsible for trade calculations, risk management, and portfolio analytics.

- **Infrastructure and Deployment**:
  - Dockerized the entire application stack.
  - Set up Nginx configurations for load balancing and reverse proxy.
  - Managed deployments and CI/CD pipelines.

- **Queue System**:
  - Designed and implemented the queue system using BullMQ for asynchronous task processing across services.

- **Frontend Development**:
  - Built frontend components for portfolio management, trade history, strategy configuration, and backtesting interfaces.
  - Developed corresponding backend APIs for these features.

### Pratham Seth

- **Market Server**:
  - Developed the entire Market Server, integrating with Yahoo Finance API for real-time market data retrieval and processing.

- **Caching Middleware**:

- **No-Code Strategy Setup**:
  - Added comprehensive no-code strategy configuration features, allowing users to define trading strategies without programming knowledge.

## Joint Contributions

### API Server

- Both contributors collaboratively developed the API Server, which serves as the central gateway for external API interactions, handling requests from the frontend and coordinating with internal services.

### Documentation

- Jointly created comprehensive documentation for the platform, including API references, setup guides, and user manuals.

### Remaining Frontend

- Equally contributed to the remaining frontend components, ensuring a cohesive user interface and seamless user experience across the application.

## Summary

The project benefited from complementary skill sets: Abhishek focused on backend architecture, authentication, calculations, and infrastructure, while Pratham specialized in market data integration, caching, and frontend market-related features. Their joint efforts on the API server, documentation, and frontend ensured a well-rounded, production-ready trading platform.

This collaborative approach resulted in a robust, scalable system capable of handling real-time trading operations with efficient data management and user-friendly interfaces.</content>
